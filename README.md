# For Farkle's Sake

## What?
This is a javascript algorithm that calculates the score of a dice roll during a game of Farkle

## Goal
* No dependencies
* 100% test coverage

## Challenges
I initially wrote it in typescript, but I wasn't able to use the node test runner with the tsc generated js files. The solution was to use a ts runner like tsx or ts-node, but I didn't want any dependencies so I had to do away with typescript.
